    <p>I'm changing my welcome screen, and move some tutorial here.
    If you are in a hurry, my old blog can be found in <a href="{{ site.url }}/pages/index">blog section</a>. 
    I'm sorry for this temporary inconvenience.
    </p>

    <h4>Simple Dashboard</h4>
    <p>This template has a responsive menu. 
    The menu will appear collapsed on smaller screens,
    and will appear non-collapsed on larger screens.
    There is a toggle button on smaller screen. 
    When toggled using the button above, the menu will appear/disappear. 
    On small screens, the page content will be pushed off canvas.</p>
